# MobileView

Easily specify mobile-specific view template for mobile devices in Rails application.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem "mobile_view", "~> 0.2.0"

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Dependency

  * Rails 3.2.x

## Usage

### `action.mobile.html.erb` View Template

#### Scenario

You have a view template for `posts#show`, with many DOM elements and JavaScripts, which is good for desktop, but painful for mobile devices. You're tired of `<%= render_something if mobile? %>` conditional hell. You want to make it mobile-friendly, with a view that is mostly different and built form scratch.

#### Solution

Add `posts/show.mobile.html.erb` along with `posts/show.html.erb`. If the browser is a mobile device, then Rails will choose the mobile template first.

It works for any format handlers (`erb`, `haml` etc.) and formats (`json`, `js`, `xml` etc.) available in your Rails application. You just have to add `mobile` after the view's name.

It also works for partial views. When a mobile version of partial view is not available, it will choose non-mobile version automatically. You just have to add `mobile` after the view's name.

It also works for layout view. So you can now use `views/layouts/application.mobile.html.erb` for mobile devices.

### `mobile?` Helper

Still want to detect mobile device in Controller and View? Use `mobile?` helper. It returns `true` if it thinks the browser is a mobile device, `false` otherwise.

To use `mobile?` helper in a mounted engine, for example, [Rails Cell](https://github.com/apotonick/cells), simply include the `MobileView::ControllerAdditions` module:

```ruby
class PostCell < Cell::Rails
  include MobileView::ControllerAdditions
end
```

## Cookie-based Mobile View Switching

By setting `mobile` cookie, you can force it to load mobile views. This is helpful when debugging the app in desktop browsers, or allowing user to switch to mobile version manually.

Example:

```ruby
class AppliactionController < ActionController::Base
  before_filter :manual_mobile_switching

  protected
  # Detects `_mobile_view` parameter.
  # If it is any value other than 0, turn on mobile view,
  # otherwise, turn off mobile view.
  def manual_mobile_switching
    mobile_view_option = params[:_mobile_view]

    if mobile_view_option
      if mobile_view_options == "1"
        cookies["mobile"] = true # or anything other than falsy value
      elsif mobile_view_option == "0"
        cookies.delete "mobile" # remove `mobile' cookie
      end
    end
  end
end
```

## Known Issues

### iPad / Tablets â†’ Mobile View

According to the algorithm of [Rack::MobileDetect](https://github.com/talison/rack-mobile-detect/), iPad will be seen as a Mobile Device. This may be a fail assumption if you want to show your desktop website to iPad and tablet users. This can (may) be resolved by replacing mobile device detection logic or add more tablet-specific methods.

## Changelog

### 0.2.0

* Support cookie-based switching
* Rename helper `mobile_device?` to `mobile?` since it now not only detects mobile device, but also accepts cookie-based switching.

### 0.1.0

:birthday: First Release

* `*.mobile` view template auto-overriding
* Automatic mobile device detection
* `mobile_device?` helper for controller and view
